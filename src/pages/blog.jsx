                    <p className="card-text">Doubts about Aston Martin's performance drop continue to hover over the paddock. Those from Silverstone had achieved six podiums in the first eight races of the season and since Austria, they have accumulated four consecutive ones without getting on the drawer. What's more, they haven't even been close, since 5th place has been the highest place in which they have crossed the finish line in these four races and the distances with the drivers above have been sky-high.

                      In Great Britain they are also looking for an explanation that is simply in an evolution, like that of Canada, which has not adapted well to the single-seater. Mike Krack stated that "I can neither confirm nor deny" that the FIA ​​​​has forced him to remove some piece on Sky Sports, but he himself nipped in the bud the conspiracy theories about the modifications in the AMR23 due to this circumstance.</p>

                    <h5 className="card-title">Not because Sergio Pérez was second: A laughing stock in the Power Rankings of the Belgian GP</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">It seems that Sergio Pérez is off the radar for motorsport 'experts', who once again ignored him in the Aramco F1 Power Rankings, now for the Belgian GP.

                      And it is that despite the fact that Checo came in second place in the race that was held in Spa-Francorchamps, he was not included in the Top 10 of the best drivers.

                      Without a doubt, the 33-year-old Mexican had a decent run at the weekend in Belgium, breaking his qualifying curse, and although he had the third fastest time, he finished second after Max Verstappen's penalty.

                      This position helped Checo Pérez for the grand prix that was held on Sunday, so much so that from lap 1 he climbed to the top after a great pass over Charles Leclerc.

                      In the end, the man from Guadalajara had to cede his position to Max Verstappen, who arrived like a missile from sixth place, to take the checkered flag at the Belgian Grand Prix; although he kept his second place.

                      Sergio Pérez's participation is to applaud, since 'Mad Max' is on another level and it was difficult for him not to be surpassed. Added to that, he helped make it another 1-2 for Red Bull and come into the Formula 1 summer break in second place in the Drivers' Championship.</p>

                    <h5 className="card-title">Helmut Marko cuts Checo Pérez's wings: "Being second behind Verstappen is like a victory"</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">With 10 victories in 12 races held so far in the 2023 Formula 1 Season for Max Verstappen, Helmut Marko is categorical with the dominance he has had.

                      The Red Bull sports adviser emphasized the slim chances their rivals have of winning the remainder of the year, including Sergio Pérez, who should feel calm if they finish in second place.

                      "Being second behind Max is like a victory," Helmut Marko told F1 Nation of the frustration some drivers, like Checo, face in not taking the checkered flag. <br />For his part, the 80-year-old Austrian manager pointed out if there is anyone else who can get close to Verstappen, other than Checo: "There will be no other driver who can have his level. Maybe Fernando Alonso or Lewis Hamilton, but nobody could beat him right now," he insisted.

                      "I know how good Max Verstappen is. He's taking care of the tires and he's still going fast, he can read the race and he's so far ahead with what he's doing that he's already passed. He has incredible ability in his head."</p>

                    <h5 className="card-title">Hamilton: "If I had Pérez's car, Verstappen would not be so good in the World Cup"</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">Max Verstappen is destroying all the records that have been and will be in Formula 1. His level of driving together with the RB19 does not give options to the rest of the rivals who must settle for reaching second place on the podium. At the beginning of the season, Checo seemed his biggest rival for the World Cup, but after 12 appointments on the calendar, there are already 125 points difference between the drivers of the Austrian team.

                      The biggest gap between two teammates at mid-season since Alonso scored 139 points from Felipe Massa in 2012. Checo was once again on the podium in Hungary and Belgium, but for some drivers like Hamilton it's not enough. The Briton believes that with the RB19, the Mexican's aspirations must be different. "Do I want to be as fast as them? Of course, do I want to have a car as fast as them? Of course," said the Mercedes. For now, the Briton is not in Red Bull's plans. He will have to settle for continuing at Brackley, in the event that his renewal is given, as his contract ends this season.</p>

                    <h5 className="card-title">"Hamilton has shown to be a bad teammate with those statements belittling Checo Pérez"</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">Hamilton has proven to be a bad teammate. Yes, he is a great driver, but his statements belittling Checo Pérez are unfortunate, incomprehensible and inadmissible. In this Formula 1 game, many things can be admitted, but never disrespect another teammate, something he has done with the Mexican.

                      From my point of view, the Briton has paid for his frustration for a season in which he has always seen Verstappen from afar and Sergio Pérez on many other occasions. That Mercedes does not provide him with a competitive car is his problem, but ensuring that if he had the Red Bull that the Mexican drives, the World Cup would be tighter is a falsehood.

                      I only hope that Checo continues to show him on the track that he is being better than him. The Mexican has been enduring attacks from many actors in this Formula 1 circus for a few weeks, but a more or less acid criticism is one thing and what Hamilton has said is quite another. The truth is that I did not expect words like that from a champion like the British.

                      I understand that between professional colleagues there have to be certain limits and what Hamilton must do is work together with his team to beat Red Bull on the track and not make these types of offensive and humiliating statements for another top driver like Sergio Pérez. . The least you should do is publicly apologize for what has been a massive blunder.</p>
